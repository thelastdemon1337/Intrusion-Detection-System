# Intrusion-Detection-System

Intrusion detection system for a site is a device that monitors the viewpoint and alerts the user for any activity that seem out of the place. I learned dealing with Raspberry Pi, GPIOs, Pi camera, yagmail library and flask for deploying the monitoring service.
The system emulates a real time security feature: Intrusion Detection System for a building. I uses passive infrared sensors for motion detection and a raspberry pi camera to record the trespasser. A python flask portal is emitted as an endpoint to monitor the real time status of the intruders.
